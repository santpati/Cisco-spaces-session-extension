# Privacy Policy for Cisco Spaces Session Extension

**Effective Date:** February 10, 2026

## 1. Introduction
The **Cisco Spaces Session Extension** ("we", "our", or "the extension") is designed to improve productivity by helping authorized users retrieve their session tokens from `dnaspaces.io`. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it.

## 2. Data Collection
We do **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.

- **Session Tokens**: The extension reads your `sys-token` (session token) from `localStorage` or `cookies` on `dnaspaces.io` strictly for the purpose of displaying it to you.
- **Local Operation**: All processing happens locally within your browser. The token is never sent to us or any third party.

## 3. Permissions Usage
- **activeTab**: Used to detect if you are currently visiting `dnaspaces.io`.
- **cookies**: Used to read the authentication cookie from `dnaspaces.io` to retrieve the session token.
- **scripting**: Used to execute a script on `dnaspaces.io` to read `localStorage`.

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
